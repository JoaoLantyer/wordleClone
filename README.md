# wordleClone
I made a really simple clone of Wordle with some stuff I've learned from Java so far, I will try to constantly improve it.

To run the jar file, open the command prompt/PowerShell on the folder that "Wordle.jar" is located and type: java â€“jar Wordle.jar (don't copy, type if yourself or else an error will occur).

PS: Type and press enter for each letter when it's prompted.
Have fun!
